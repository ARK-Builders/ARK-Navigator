You can find fresh builds as artifacts of [GitHub Actions workflows](https://github.com/ARK-Builders/ARK-Navigator/actions):
* The most recent stable APK file is produced from `main` branch
* Every workflow must have both _Release_ and _Debug_ build

### Automated code style checks

The projects embeds `ktlint` in order to enforce consistent code style.

Before a PR can be merged, you would have to fix all code style errors.

### Code review

We care a lot about our software quality, that's why we are conducting strict code reviews before merging:
* we will ask questions if we are not sure about particular technical decision
* when possible, we will suggest alternative solution
* GitHub Actions workflow must result in success (be green)
* comments must be resolved before merge
* code style should be green as well

Right now, the team isn't that big, so please be patient ðŸ™‚

### Merge conflicts

If Pull Request is long time in reviewing phase, `main` branch might go forward too far.
Please, fix all merge conflicts in this case ðŸ›
